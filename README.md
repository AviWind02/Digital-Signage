**# Digital-Signage**# Digital Signage Project

This repository contains the code for a Digital Signage application developed in C#. The application is designed to display a variety of media content, including images, PowerPoint presentations, and videos, on a digital screen in the form of a slideshow. Additionally, the application introduces a concept called "level images," which are images that appear more frequently than other media content, allowing users to prioritize certain visuals.

## Features

- Displays images from the "Digital-Signage" folder in the "Documents" directory
- Plays videos stored in the designated directory
- Shows PowerPoint presentations (currently under bug fixing)
- Supports the addition of images while the application is running (work in progress)
- Provides a user interface for managing images and running text (work in progress)

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AviWind02/Digital-Signage.git

2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.

3. Resolve any dependencies or missing packages if prompted.

4. Build the solution to ensure all necessary components are compiled.

5. Configure the application by adjusting settings such as folder paths and display preferences, if needed.

6. Run the application and enjoy your digital signage display!

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, it will continuously cycle through the available media content, displaying them on the digital screen. The frequency of "level images" can be adjusted to control how often they appear compared to other images.

To add new media content while the application is running, follow these steps:

1. Place the desired image or video file in the designated directory.

2. The application will automatically detect the new media and incorporate it into the slideshow.

## Known Issues

Currently, there is a bug affecting the display of PowerPoint presentations.
